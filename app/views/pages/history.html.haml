			he On Kee Jazz Band has been providing smooth and jazzy live entertainment since 1993.  The band initially played live with national recording group, 
			“Classic Example”, headed by Maurice Starr.  In 1994, OnKee realized that they had a common love for jazz and original music.  While pursuing that 
			direction and the willingness to take risks, the band pursued respectable Jazz Clubs in the Boston metropolitan area.After hard work, and partnering 
			with various talented musicians, OnKee developed a strong fan base that allowed them to perform at various venues.

			OnKee often performed at the Historic Connolly’s Jazz Club in Roxbury and the 1359 Jazz Club in Cambridge, MA.  Once the band discovered a balance 
			of Jazz standards and original music, OnKee began to perform at Ryles Jazz Club in Cambridge and G Clef in Providence, RI which was once a powerhouse 
			for showcases of national and local acts.

			Some of the	band’s most outreaching performances took place during the year of 1996, opening for National recording Jazz Artists, Jeff Lober and 
			Bob James at G Clef.  In 1997, the band performed at the 1997 NSBE (National Society of Black Engineers) Convention at the Prudential Building in 
			Boston.  In addition, they maintain a firm commitment and dedication to the community by donating their time to the Special Olympics, an event held 
			annually at Stonehill College in Easton, MA.

			The band was very fortunate to perform four years in a row at this event until Lenny relocated to Maryland.  Other events include playing at a 
			benefit for the New England Shelter for Homeless Veterans at the House of Blues Club in Cambridge and in 1998 performed at the “Steppin Out Gala” 
			a fundraiser for the Dimock Community Health Center.

		%p 
			In 2004, OnKee performed at the Democratic Convention in honor of the National Education Association.  In October 2005, OnKee proudly introduced its 
			first CD release “Giving Back” which helped to raise money for the Lupus Foundation in the New England area.  OnKee has since produced two other CD 
			releases; “Live at Mars” and “Positivity.”  The bands fourth CD was recently released in the Fall of 2010.
		%p 
			Over the past several years, OnKee supported various events to include a Lupus Foundation fundraiser held in Glen Burnie, MD April 2008 and have 
			recently provided weekly performances at the Stonefish Grill, Peachez Lounge &amp; Caf&eacute; (both located in Upper Marlboro, MD) and the Westin Hotel in 
			Alexandria, VA.
			
		%p 
			The jazzy sounds of OnKee were initially due to the band members located within the Boston, MA metro area:  Lenny McLean, keyboards and band leader; Bass Greg Silva 
			from Quincy; Drums Darin Fry from Cambridge; Saxophones Rasheed Meadows from Boston; two Percussionists, Carl Parks from Dorchester and Moses from 
			Bridgewater. 
			 
		%p 	
			After relocating to Maryland, Lenny formed a second OnKee Jazz Band within the DMV (D.C., Maryland, Virginia) metropolitan area.  The current members of the band 
			include the following:  Bass, Aubrey McCoy from Waldorf, MD; Drums, Kenny Trusty from Baltimore, MD; Saxophones, Ralph &ldquo;Rhube&rdquo; Peters from Lanham, MD; 
			and Percussion, Dave Dillard.  The band members are full-time employed and are part-time 
			musicians willing to explore new ideas and arrangements to Jazz standards as well as create their own style.  The members are inspired and influenced 
			by many artists such as Joe Sample, Elvin Jones, Sonny Rollins, Don Alias and Jaco Pastorius.  Since relocating to Maryland, Lenny is blessed to have 
			musicians willing to continue the OnKee legacy by playing in both Boston and Washington D.C. bands.
			
		%p 
			OnKee is committed to family, a firm spiritual foundation, and the continuation of providing unique and jazzy music to its fan base across the Eastern 
			Seaboard, the country, and abroad.
